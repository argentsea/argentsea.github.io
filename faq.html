    <div class="question">Q: What happens if I need something that this framework won’t do?</div>
    <div class="answer">A: ArgentSea is a simple layer over ADO.Net. You can easily ammend its functionality be simply coding your unique requirements directly in ADO.Net, as you would have done before.</div>

    <div class="question">Q: Is this an ORM (object-releational mapper)? If so/not, how is this different?</div>
    <div class="answer">A: ArgentSea does allow you to easily map between stored procedure results and object models, so it is an ORM. Unlike other popular ORMs it is meant to work exclusively with stored procedures.</div>

    <div class="question">Q: Why is it better to work with stored procedures?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        A: Lots of reasons. Stored procedures:
        <ul>
            <li>Do not require the database engine to parse your SQL string, so this can have a (very small) performance benefit.</li>
            <li>Allow DBAs to see exactly what a query will do, without requiring a server trace or logging.</li>
            <li>Review and approve data access code changes.</li>
            <li>Allow DBAs to fix poorly performing SQL much more easily (rewriting SQL, adding hints [only when essential], evaluating indexes, etc.</li>
            <li>Improve security by eliminating injection attacks (assuming no dynamic SQL within the sproc).</li>
            <li>Comprehensively determine which tables/views/columns are accessed by the application (assuming only EXECUTE permissions) and how they are leveraged.</li>
        </ul>

        More importantly,

        have cached execution plans, so they require less work do not require the data base engine to ArgentSea does allow you to easily map between data entities and object models, so it is an ORM. Unlike other popular ORMs it is meant to work exclusively with stored procedures.

    <div class="question">Q: How can I make sure that my data is secure?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        A: Start by hiring an knowledgable DBA.
        <ul>
            ArgentSea helps in a few ways:
            <li>It helps ensure that your application can run with only EXECUTE permissions on stored procedures. This prevents the application from running arbitrary SQL statements on SQL Server (although SQL statements can be sent to PostgreSQL). This can help mitigate SQL injection attacks and also mistaken SQL statements that corrupt data.</li>
            <li>It’s configuration design helps protect against unsafe storage of login passwords.</li>
        </ul>
